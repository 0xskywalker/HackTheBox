This is an important security notice. We are sorry to inform you that the passwords of some of your Active Directory integrated PRTG user accounts and the passwords of some other accounts configured in PRTG Network Monitor have been exposed. An internal PRTG Network Monitor error caused some passwords to be written to the PRTG Configuration.dat file in plain text.

We strongly recommend that you change the affected passwords immediately.

We found that the passwords of the following Active Directory integrated PRTG user accounts have been exposed:

REDACTED

Note: If a user account was deleted in a PRTG Network Monitor version after 17.4.35.3326 (released November 16th, 2017), it will not appear in this list.

We also found that passwords of other accounts have been exposed, all of which are configurable under Setup | System Administration in the PRTG web interface:

Active Directory integration account. Affected user: REDACTED

With the PRTG Network Monitor version you're running now, we have already encrypted the passwords in the current PRTG Configuration.dat file. However, automatically generated copies of the file still exist in the PRTG data path (for example, PRTG Configuration.old). In addition to this, PRTG Network Monitor has created daily configuration backup copies in a dedicated subfolder. It is very likely that these copies also contain unencrypted passwords. All copies generated by a PRTG Network Monitor version 17.4.35.3326 or later can be affected.

What's next?

We recommend that you delete all affected copies of the PRTG Configuration.dat file:

    Automatically generated backups under:

    C:\ProgramData\Paessler\PRTG Network Monitor\Configuration Auto-Backups\

    Automatically generated temporary files that may exist:

    C:\ProgramData\Paessler\PRTG Network Monitor\PRTG Configuration.old

    C:\ProgramData\Paessler\PRTG Network Monitor\PRTG Configuration.nul

    If you run PRTG Network Monitor in cluster mode, please also remember to remove the configuration backups in the PRTG data path on every failover node.

    Also remember that you may have additional copies of the PRTG Configuration.dat file for backup purposes. We recommend deleting all affected copies of this file.

We apologize for the inconvenience caused.
